# NEUWON

NEUWON is a simulation framework for neuroscience and artificial intelligence
specializing in conductance based models. This software is a modern remake of
the NEURON simulator. It is accurate, efficient, and easy to use.

## Model Architecture

#### Physical Structures

This section describes how NEUWON represents the physical shape of a neuron.

Neurons are composed of discrete segments which are connected into a tree
structure. The shape of each segment is a frustum, also known as a truncated
cone. The physical locations of the tips of the frustums in the system serve as
tracking points for all cellular processes: intracellular, extracellular, and
membrane-related. The extracellular space is partitioned into voronoi cells
which are centered on the tracking points. NEUWON provides the following
geometric properties about each tracking point:

* Cell Segment Properties
    + Length
    + Diameter
    + Cross-sectional Area
    + Membrane Surface Area
    + Intracellular Volume
    + Tree Structure
        - Parent Segment, unless segment is root of tree
        - Child Segments, list
* Extracellular Space Properties
    + Volume
    + Adjacent Tracking Points
        - Distance between points
        - Surface Area of border

#### Reactions & Diffusions

The brain uses chemical reactions to implement arbitrary logic. Large proteins
can maintain a persistent state, and when embedded in the cell membrane can
sense and control the electrical potential across the membrane. Chemicals can
diffuse through the interior of a neuron, through the extracellular space
between cells, and across cell membranes. Electrically charged ions flow
throughout neurons; a phenomenon which is modeled with an equivalent electrical
circuit.

## Integration Methods

#### Exact Integration

NEUWON uses the exact integration method introduced by (Rotter & Diesmann, 1999).

#### Staggered Integration

Reactions and diffusions interact at staggered time steps, as explained in
chapter 4 of the NEURON book.
