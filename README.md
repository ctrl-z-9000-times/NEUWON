# NEUWON

NEUWON is a simulation framework for neuroscience and artificial intelligence
specializing in conductance based models. This software is a modern remake of
the NEURON simulator. It is accurate, efficient, and easy to use.

## Methods

#### Exact Integration

NEUWON uses the exact integration method introduced by (Rotter & Diesmann, 1999)
to simulate diffusion and electric current through passive circuit components.

systems with applications to neuronal modeling. Biol Cybern 81, 381â€“402 (1999).

#### Staggered Integration

Reactions and diffusions interact at staggered time steps, as explained in
chapter 4 of the NEURON book.
